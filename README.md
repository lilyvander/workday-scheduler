Workday Scheduler Readme
Overview
This Workday Scheduler is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. It allows users to schedule tasks for their workday, record those tasks on the page, and store them in the browser's local storage. The scheduler also provides visual cues by changing the background color of each time block based on whether it is in the past (grey), present (red), or future (green).

Features
1. Adding Tasks
Users can easily add tasks by clicking on the text area within the respective time block and entering the task details. Pressing the "Save" button will store the task in the local storage.

2. Recording Tasks
The scheduled tasks are displayed on the page below each corresponding time block, providing users with a clear overview of their daily schedule.

3. Local Storage
The application utilizes the browser's local storage to persistently store the scheduled tasks. This ensures that the tasks remain available even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.

4. Color-coded Time Blocks
The time blocks are color-coded to provide a visual representation of the current time of day:

Grey: Past time blocks
Red: Current time block
Green: Future time blocks
